  <h2>About this Book</h2>
  <p>This is a textbook for the second year of a computer
  science or "media informatics" degree program.  It builds
  on <a href="https://web-development.github.io">Web Development</a> 
  (in german) and runs parallel to
  <a href="https://backend-development.github.io">Backend Development</a>.</p>

  <p>This book is not a self-contained work: There are great
  resources for learning about the tools and technologies of web engineering
  - this book tries to use
  these resources, and bind them together into a coherent study plan.</p>

  <p>It was written and published by Brigitte Jellinek 
  in the hope that it will be useful to lecturers and students
  in educational institutions as well as to self-directed learners on the internet.

<h3>What is Web Engineering</h3>

<p>Under this title we collect all the stuff that
does not fit neatly into "backend" or "frontend" development:
workflows, tools, operations.
